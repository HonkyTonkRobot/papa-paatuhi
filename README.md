# Papa Pātuhi
I'm on my te Reo Māori learning journey, and I'm also an avid typer. I was not satisfied with the options available, so decided to start making my own.

Most operating systems had a NZ Māori keyboard which would include hitting the 'alt' or the '`' backtick key to give you access to the vowels with macron's. ie. alt + a = ā , alt + e = ē , etc.

I wanted to make a keyboard layout that was envisioned for te Reo Māori, and not just an add on to English.

Here's what I've got so far. Please give it a go and let me know your thoughts.
